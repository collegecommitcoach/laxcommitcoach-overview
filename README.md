## Customer Success Approach

This platform embodies customer success principles at its core:

### Contextual User Guidance
The AI chatbot acts as a strategic advisor, not just a Q&A tool. It synthesizes:
- Complete communication history with coaches and colleges
- User's stated preferences and goals
- Current stage in the recruiting journey
- Past actions and progress patterns

This delivers personalized, actionable guidance that adapts as users progress, mirroring how a CSM provides increasingly sophisticated guidance as customers mature.

### Adoption & Engagement Metrics
Built with user activation and engagement as primary success metrics:
- Profile completion tracking to drive initial adoption
- Activity logging and streak tracking for habit formation
- Gamification system to reinforce desired behaviors
- Progress milestones to celebrate user advancement

### Proactive Health Monitoring
Multi-dimensional health scoring across:
- Communication activity (are users actively reaching out?)
- Engagement levels (are they logging activities and updating their pipeline?)
- Progress velocity (are they advancing through recruiting stages?)
- Relationship sentiment (are coach interactions positive or concerning?)

### Data-Driven Insights
- Pipeline analytics showing conversion rates between stages
- Response time analytics revealing coach engagement levels
- Communication sentiment trends over time
- User journey optimization based on successful patterns

### Relationship Intelligence
The sentiment analysis engine proactively identifies:
- Declining engagement from coaches
- Negative tone shifts in communications
- Stalled opportunities requiring intervention
- Positive momentum to amplify

This mirrors how CSMs use health scores and engagement data to identify at-risk accounts and expansion opportunities.

### Progressive Disclosure
Features and guidance adapt based on:
- User's current recruiting stage
- Profile completeness
- Experience level with the platform
- Demonstrated needs and behaviors
